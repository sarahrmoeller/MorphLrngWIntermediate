This is the code I used to set up data for the OpenNMT part of the experiment in my paper: 

Moeller, Sarah, Ghazaleh Kazeminejad, Andrew Cowell & Mans Hulden. 2019. Improving Low-Resource Morphological Learning with Intermediate Forms from Finite State Transducers. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Methods for Endangered Languages, vol. 1. Honolulu, HI. https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-6011/.

# Python Code
Code in .ipynb is not clean, has useless fucntions, and the key function processdump() is buggy. I have not had time to clean it up. 

Bug only shows up occassionally, just run it again. 

# Foma
Foma script for extracting surface, intermediate, and parsed forms coming...
