This is the code I used to set up data for the OpenNMT part of the experiment in my paper: 

@inproceedings{moeller_improving_2019,

	title = {Improving {Low}-{Resource} {Morphological} {Learning} with {Intermediate} {Forms} from {Finite} {State} {Transducers}},

	author = {Moeller, Sarah and Kazeminejad, Ghazaleh and Cowell, Andrew and Hulden, Mans},

	booktitle = {Proceedings of the {Workshop} on {Computational} {Methods} for {Endangered} {Languages}},
  	
	volume = {1},
	
	year = {2019},
	
	address = {Honolulu, HI},
}

# Python Code
Code in .ipynb is not clean, has useless fucntions, and the key function processdump() is buggy. I have not had time to clean it up. 

Bug only shows up occassionally, just run it again. 

# Foma
Foma script for extracting surface, intermediate, and parsed forms coming...
